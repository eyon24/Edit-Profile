# Edit Profile Page App

### Author - Eric Yon

# Description

App allows user to enter and edit their name, phone number, email, and about me. The app displays all of the user's information, and they can click on a section to edit.

# Requirements

- Node 14 LTS or greater
- Expo CLI
  - npm install -g expo-cli
- Expo Go App (Google Play or App Store)

# Installation

The application is run and built with React-Native and Expo. After cloning the app, run the command "npm start" in the powershell. The command should prompt various options as well as a qr code. Open the expo go application on your phone and scan the qr code. It is important that the phone is connected to the same network as the computer running the code. The application should then be running on the phone.

### Note:

I do not have access to and IOS device. I know that react-native has some different displays on android and IOS, but I could not find a way to run an Iphone emulator without having an IOS device. The app was only tested with an android device.
